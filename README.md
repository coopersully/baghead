**This project was made for a twenty-four (24) hour game jam and is not actively developed.**

Made in Unity with C#, Baghead is a 3D, side-scrolling platformer game in which a young boy must save his kidnapped sister by battling monsters and collecting items. The game features completely custom assets: 3D models, textures, voice overs, sound effects, scripts, and more.
